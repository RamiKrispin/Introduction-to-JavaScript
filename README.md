## Introduction to JavaScript

This tutorial covers the basic functionality operations of the JavaScript (JS) language, covering the following topics:

* Setting VScode environment
* Basic workflow
* Variables
* Functions
* Data structure

### Prerequisites 

Here are the assumptions I made when I created this tutorial:

* No previous knowledge of JS
* Have basic knowledge of another programming language (e.g., Python, R, Julia, etc.), and an understanding of the use of variables assignment and functions

In addition, we will use some basic HTML and CSS throughout the tutorial, donâ€™t worry if you are unfamiliar with those languages.
