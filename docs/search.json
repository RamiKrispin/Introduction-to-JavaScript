    "text": "1.2 Settings\nBefore getting started, let’s set the development environment. There are many ways to develop and execute JavaScript. For this tutorial, I use VScode, which has great integrations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and seamless integration with Docker. In addition, it has great integration with Quarto, which was used to create this document. If you want to follow the same settings, check the instructions below.\n\n1.2.1 VScode Settings for JavaScript\nIf you don’t have VScode installed, you can download and install it directly from the VScode website. I also use the following extensions:\n\nLive Server extension, which enables you to launch a local development server with a live reload feature for static & dynamic pages\nDev Containers extension, supporting development on VScode with Docker containers\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Setting Docker Environment\nOne of the main reasons I love using VScode is the seamless integration with Docker. It enables you to develop in your local folder while executing the code inside the image. Here is what you need to set your VScode to run inside a Docker image:\n\nDocker Desktop (or equivalent) install on your machine (download and install it from here)\nDocker extension for VScode\nSet the supporting image, here are the Docker settings I am using for this tutorial\nCreate the devcontainer.json file with your container settings (image name, environment variables, extension names, etc.), here is my devcontainer.json file setting\nOpen the folder inside the container (see the screenshot below)\n\n\nYou can read more about setting and using Docker with VScode on VScode’s documentation.\nIf you want to leverage the tutorial Docker settings, you can clone the repository and follow the next steps:\n\nOpen the tutorial repository’s folder on VScode\nOpen the Command Palette (⇧⌘P in Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows) or use the Open Remote Window button (on the bottom left side, see the screen recording above) and type Open Folder in Container.\n\nNote: It might take few minutes on the first time opening the container, as it pull the docker image from Docker Hub."

    "text": "1.3 Getting started with JavaScript\nJavaScript (also known as JS), is one of the most popular programming languages for web development. It is typically used to create web page applications, mobile apps, games, and great data visualization tools (D3, Observable Plot, Leaflet, Charts, etc.). You can run JavaScript on your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.):\nScreen record here*\nWhile you can use your web browser as a consul for ad-hoc code tests, the development of JS applications is done inside a script using a code editor such VScode, notepad, etc. It is common to have JS code embedded inside HTML script (or call JS script from HTML script).\n\n1.3.1 Workflow\nIn this tutorial, we will adopt the basic framework for running JS code on the browser by setting a web page with an HTML file (index.html) and leveraging it to call a JS file (index.js) with our JS code. In addition, we will use a CSS file (style.css) to set the web page style. I will set those files under the JavaScript folder:\n.\n├── index.html\n├── index.js\n└── style.ccs\nNote: For convenience, I placed the three files in the same folder. However, if you wish to arrange it differently, you can easily reference the index.js and style.css file paths from the index.html file.\nDon’t worry if you are not familiar with HTML or CSS. We will use the basic templates to set those files. Let’s start by creating three empty files using the file names above. To set the HTML file, we will use the VScode HTML code snippet template by typing the ! symbol and press enter:\n\nIn a nutshell, the HTML file we created contains the following two main elements:\n\nhead - Use to define the page metadata and settings\nbody - Use to set the page content\n\nAn excellent resource to read about the head and body tags, or any other tags, is the w3schools website.\nindex.html:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Document</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\nHere are a few things we are going to modify and add to this file:\n\nThe <title> tag under the <head> defines the web browser’s tab title. Let’s modify it from Document to Introduction to JS\nSet the page CSS by linking the style.css file to the page <head> element using the link tag\n\nindex.html:\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Introduction to JS</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href = \"style.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\nNow is a good time to start using the VScode’s live server extension we installed before. This extension will enable us to instantaneously review the changes we apply to the index.html file on the web browser as we update and save the code. To launch the live server on VScode, go to the EXPLORER tab left side and right-click on the index.html file. That should pop up a window with options, select Open with Live Server option:\n\nOnce we created the index.html file using VScode template, we can link the style.css by reference the file with the link function on the HTML head elemenet (again, don’t worry if you are not familiar with HTML):\n```"

This extension will enable us to instantaneously review the changes we apply to the index.html file on the web browser as we update and save the code. If you have wide screen, I recommand to open side-by-side VScode and your default browser and see, while coding, the changes in the browser. To launch the live server on VScode, go to the EXPLORER tab left side and right-click on the index.html file. That should pop up a window with options, select Open with Live Server option:\n\nThat’s it! we are ready to write our first JS code!"
