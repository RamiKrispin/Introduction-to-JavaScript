For this tutorial, I use VScode, which has great integrations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and seamless integration with Docker. In addition, it has great integration with Quarto, which was used to create this document. If you want to follow the same settings, check the instructions below.\n\n1.1.1 VScode Settings for JavaScripts\nIf you don’t have VScode installed, you can download and install it directly from the VScode website. I also using the Live Server extension, which enables you to launch a local development server with a live reload feature for static & dynamic pages.\n\n\n1.1.2 Docker\nOne of the main reasons I love using VScode is the seamless integration with Docker. It enables you to develop in your local folder while executing the code inside the image. Here is what you need to set your VScode to run inside a Docker image:\n\nDocker Desktop (or equivalent) install on your machine (download and install it from here)\nDocker extension for VScode\nSet the supporting image, here are the Docker settings I am using for this tutorial\nCreate the devcontainer.json file with your container settings (image name, environment variables, extension names, etc.), here is my devcontainer.json file setting\nOpen the folder inside the container (see the screenshot below)"
