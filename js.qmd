# Introduction to JavaScript

WIP...pre spelling check

This tutorial covers the basic functionality operations of the JavaScript (JS) language, covering the following topics:

* Setting VScode environment
* Basic workflow
* Variables
* Functions
* Data structure

## Prerequisites 

Here are the assumptions I made when I created this tutorial:

* No previous knowledge of JS
* Have basic knowledge of another programming language (e.g., Python, R, Julia, etc.), and an understanding of the use of variables assignment and functions

In addition, we will use some basic HTML and CSS throughout the tutorial, don’t worry if you are unfamiliar with those languages.

## Settings

Before getting started, let's set the development environment. There are many ways to develop and execute JavaScript. For this tutorial, I use VScode, which has great integrations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and seamless integration with Docker. In addition, it has great integration with Quarto, which was used to create this document. If you want to follow the same settings, check the instructions below.

### VScode Settings for JavaScripts

If you don't have VScode installed, you can download and install it directly from the [VScode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I also use the following extensions:

* [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension, which enables you to launch a local development server with a live reload feature for static & dynamic pages
* [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension, supporting development on VScode with Docker containers

### Setting Docker Environment

One of the main reasons I love using VScode is the seamless integration with Docker. It enables you to develop in your local folder while executing the code inside the image. Here is what you need to set your VScode to run inside a Docker image:

* Docker Desktop (or equivalent) install on your machine (download and install it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
* Docker [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) for VScode
* Set the supporting image, [here](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/Tutorials/tree/main/docker) are the Docker settings I am using for this tutorial
* Create the devcontainer.json file with your container settings (image name, environment variables, extension names, etc.), [here](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/Tutorials/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) is my `devcontainer.json` file setting
* Open the folder inside the container (see the screenshot below)

You can read more about setting and using Docker with VScode on [VScode's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview).


If you want to leverage the tutorial Docker settings, you can clone the repository and follow the next steps:

* Open the tutorial repository's folder on VScode
* Open the `Command Palette` (⇧⌘P in Mac, Ctrl+Shift+P in Windows) or use the `Open Remote Window` button (on the bottom left side, see the screen recording above) and type `Open Folder in Container`.

**Note:** It might take few minutes on the first time opening the container, as it pull the docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rkrispin/tutorial).

## Getting started with JavaScript

JavaScript (also known as JS), is one of the most popular programming lannguage for web development. It typically used to create web pages applications, mobile apps, games, and great data visualizations tools. You can run JavaScript on your web-browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.):

**Screen record here***

While you can use your web-browser as consul for ad-hoc code test, the development of JS applications done inside a script using code editor such VScode, notepade, etc. It is common to have JS code embaded inside HTML script (or calling JS script from HTML script). 

### Workflow

In this tutorial, we will use the following three files to excute JS code on the browser:
* `index.js` - the main JS file we
* `index.html`
* `style.css`

``` shell
.
├── index.html
├── index.js
└── style.ccs
```
